# SPAM AND HAM DETECTION 
A dataset is used which contains random files of spam and ham,that uses feature vectorization for processing the data before sending it to model.For model prediction we used **Naive Bayes Classifier** which gave the accuracy around **96%**.For actual implementation **Flask** is used for GUI. 
The total number of data is 3112
